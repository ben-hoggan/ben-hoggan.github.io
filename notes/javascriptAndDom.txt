As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:

Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would have wanted to read when you first started learning these concepts, or to a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning.

An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
If a website is a house then HTML is what we want the contents of the house to be, CSS is how we position, color and decorate the contents of the house.

Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
Every evening you will have a set list of things to do before bed, e.g. eat dinner, watch TV to relax, dress for bed, get into bed, go to sleep.
We could think of this as an array (ordered set) of things we need to do before bed.
We could then loop through this array of before sleep activities, completing one as a time till we are in bed sleeping.

Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for interacting and changing what we might see in our browser.
You might use it to search for classes on a page or test a page's functionality.

Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
Arrays have an index from 0 to the length of the array - 1; you can access an item in an array using it's index position in the array.
Objects have key value pairs; you access the value using the key associated with it.

Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
A function is a block of code with a set of actions to be followed upon being called (activated).
They are useful for having an interactive site, e.g. when you click a button on a website, do all these things.

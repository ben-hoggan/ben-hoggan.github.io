Reflection
Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:

What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
I learn more about my values and identity. I solidified my understanding on what a growth mindset is and how neuroplasticity works. I learnt the value of EQ in a working environment.

What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
They help with coding in a real work environment. Having these skills will improve team skills and coding is usually done as a team.

What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
How much I enjoyed researching the core topics. I had heard Dev Academy had these core lessons, I was at first unsure of them but open minded. Now I agree with the teachings.

What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
Self reflection. With code we had the terminal or an error message to explain if we had made an error, with core learning it is a lot more difficult to evaluate.

Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
To my knowledge this is a practical programming school, focusing on getting it's students into the workforce as soon as possible. I think there would be evidence to show the value of the core learnings in the real world which drives Dev Academy to continue teaching it.

Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
Time spent studying core learning here did not feel like a waste of time. I think they were valuable lessons and I believe they will be helpful skills to have when applying for programming positions.

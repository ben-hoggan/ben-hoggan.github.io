          <p>
            Believing/understanding your brain/neural connections can improve will encourage people to try to improve. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Understanding how important repetition and practice are makes me want to keep going over fundamentals to strengthen my understanding of them.
          </p>

            What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Repetition, Practice, Use It and Improve It etc.

            Research Growth Mindset
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is having the belief you can improve yourself, your skills, and your abilities. It is the contrary to a Fixed Mindset, the belief that you, your skills and your abilities are set and cannot be improved past your pre-set limits. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I found that the definition for a Growth Mindset is not only having the belief you can grow and improve but it is also a way of thinking to stay positive when faced with challenges and setbacks in life.
          </p>
          <h3>
            How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Having the knowledge that I can improve despite facing challenging times will motivate myself to keep at it even when times are tough.

            Does not affect long term goals or career pathways. Does not impact my current strengths or limitations. It does change the way I think about the skills I want to develop though, having the knowledge I can improve my currently lacking skills improves my outlook on facing these obstacles.

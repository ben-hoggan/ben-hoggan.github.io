            What was the problem?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was attempting to declare an object variable, it was not working and the error message was nonsensical.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I attempted to Google but this was not helpful as the error message did not make sense. I console logged, everything looked like it should. Lastly I asked a peer for assistance, they pointed out an obvious syntax error in my code.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How did you feel throughout the process?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Did not feel upset in any way while trying to fix the issue. However, after it was resolved, I was annoyed because it was something I should have already known.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What did you learn?
          </h3>

          <h3>
            What was the problem?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The unjumble function in the JS Olympics which reverses string characters.

          <h3>
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Trying something, came up with a solution but it was junky with too many lines. Improving your process with reflection, tried to see where I could reduce lines of code. Googling, found an even better solution to the same problem online and used that.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How did you feel throughout the process?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Felt good finding and using a clean solution to the problem. Didn't feel good that I couldn't know the best solution right away.
          </p>

            What did you learn?

            How to Google for better solutions. How to use JS methods better.
